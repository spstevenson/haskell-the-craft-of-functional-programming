module UsePictures where
import PicturesSVG

-- Functions for exercise 2.1

-- Take the horse from PicturesSVG and invert the colours

blackHorse :: Picture
blackHorse = invertColour horse

whiteHorse :: Picture
whiteHorse = invertColour horse

-- Rotate is already defined in Pictures so I think this task must
-- be an error of some kind

-- get the horse and rotate it directly in this

rotate :: Picture -> Picture
rotate = flipH . flipV

rotateHorse :: Picture
rotateHorse = rotate horse

-- For exercise 2.2 two different ways of achieving the picture are as follows

checkerBoardTwoByTwo :: Picture
checkerBoardTwoByTwo = above (beside white black) (beside black white)

checkerBoardTwoByTwoMethod2 :: Picture
checkerBoardTwoByTwoMethod2 = beside (above white black) (above black white)

-- Exercise 2.4 Producing the three variants of the horse pictures

variant1 :: Picture
variant1 = above (beside horse blackHorse) (beside blackHorse horse)

variant2 :: Picture
variant2 = above (beside horse blackHorse) (beside (flipV blackHorse) (flipV horse))

variant3 :: Picture
variant3 = above (beside horse blackHorse) (beside (rotate blackHorse) (rotate horse))

-- Exercise 2.5 Producing a fourth variant1

variant4 :: Picture
variant4 = above (beside horse blackHorse) (beside (flipH blackHorse) (flipH horse))
