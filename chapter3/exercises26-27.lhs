3.26 Rewrite your solutions to the earlier exercises to use the recommended
layout.

All done!

3.27 Given the definitions

funny x = x+x
 peculiar y = y
 
explain what happens when you remove the space in front of the peculiar.

> funny :: Int -> Int
> peculiar :: Int -> Int

> funny x = x + x
> peculiar y = y

When we remove the space we conform to the offside rule and the script
loads successfully.
