3.5 Give line by line calculations of

nAnd True True
nAnd True False

for each of your definitions of nAnd in the previous exercise.

For the first definition

nAnd x y = not (x && y)

True && True results in True,
the not operator then negates this so the result is False.

True && False results in False,
the not operator then negates this so the result is True,

With the second definition

nAnd2 True True = False
nAnd2 False False = True
nAnd2 True False = True
nAnd2 False False = True

True True is directly mapped by literals on the left hand side to False.
True False is directly mapped by literals on the left hand side to True.
