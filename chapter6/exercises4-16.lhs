6.4 Define a function

superimposeChar :: Char -> Char -> Char

so that the superimposition of '.' with itself gives '.' while any other
combination of characters gives '#'.

> superimposeChar :: Char -> Char -> Char
> superimposeChar char1 char2
>  | char1 == '.' && char2 == '.' = '.'
>  | otherwise = '#'

6.5 Define a function

superimposeLine :: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char]

which takes two lines - which you can assume are of the same length -
and superimposes their corresponding characters using the superimposeChar,
so that, for example

superimposeLine ".##." ".#.#" = ".###"

You may want to use zip in your solution.

> superimposeLine :: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char]
> superimposeLine line1 line2 = [superimposeChar char1 char2 | (char1,char2) <- zip line1 line2]

6.6 In an similar way to superimposeLine, define the function

superimpose :: Picture -> Picture -> Picture

which superimposes two pictures, which you may assume have the same
dimensions.

> superimpose :: Picture -> Picture -> Picture
> superimpose pic1 pic2 = [superimposeLine line1 line2 | (line1,line2) <- zip pic1 pic2]

6.7 Using the function putStr :: String -> IO () and any other functions you
might need, define the function

printPicture :: Picture -> IO ()

so that the effect of printPicture [".##.",".#.#",".###","####"]
is that

: .##.
: .#.#
: .###
: ####

is printed at the terminal window. Hint: it is enought to transform this list of
strings to the single string

".##.\n.#.#\n.###\n####\n"

and to pass that to putStr.

> printPicture :: Picture -> IO ()
> printPicture picture = putStr (concat [line ++ "\n" | line <- picture])

6.8 [Harder] Define a function

rotate90 :: Picture -> Picture

which rotates a picture through 90 degrees clockwise. For instance, the
effect of rotate90 on the picture in the previous exercise would be to
give

: #...
: ####
: ##.#
: ###.

Hint: you need to make a line of the new picture by picking out the ith
elements in each of the lines of the original picture, reflected in a
horizontal mirror.

> rotate90 :: Picture -> Picture
> rotate90 pic 
>  | length pic == 0 = pic
>  | pictureWidth pic == 0 = pic
>  | otherwise = [rotateLine n pic | n <- [0.. (pictureWidth pic) - 1]]

> rotateLine :: Int -> Picture -> [Char]
> rotateLine col pic = reverse [ line !! col | line <- pic]

> pictureWidth :: Picture -> Int
> pictureWidth pic = length (head pic)

6.9 Using rotate90 or otherwise, define a function which rotates a
picture through 90 degrees anticlockwise.

> rotate270 :: Picture -> Picture
> rotate270 pic = (rotate90 . rotate90 . rotate90) pic

6.10 [Harder] Define the function

scale :: Picture -> Int -> Picture

which scales the input picture by the integer provided
as the second argument. For instance, if exPic is the
picture

: #.#
: ..#

then the result of scale exPic 2 should be

: ##..##
: ##..##
: ....##
: ....##

In the case of a zero or negative scale factor, you should return
an empty picture.

> repeatTimes :: a -> Int -> [a]
> repeatTimes item n
>  | n > 1 = (repeatTimes item (n-1)) ++ [item]
>  | n == 1 = [item]
>  | otherwise = []

> stretchLineHorizontally :: [Char] -> Int -> [Char]
> stretchLineHorizontally line scale = concat [repeatTimes char scale | char <- line]

> stretchPictureHorizontally :: Picture -> Int -> Picture
> stretchPictureHorizontally pic scale = [stretchLineHorizontally line scale | line <- pic]

6.11 Correct the property prop_AboveFlipH given earlier.

> prop_AboveFlipH :: Picture -> Picture -> Bool
> prop_AboveFlipH pic1 pic2 =
>     flipH (pic1 `above` pic2) == (flipH pic2) `above` (flipH pic1)

6.12 Define properties which describe how beside interacts with flipH and flipV.

> prop_BesideFlipV :: Picture -> Picture -> Bool
> prop_BesideFlipV pic1 pic2 =
>    flipV (pic1 `beside` pic2) == flipV pic2 `beside` flipV pic1

> prop_BesideFlipH :: Picture -> Picture -> Property
> prop_BesideFlipH pic1 pic2 =
>    (length pic1 == length pic2) 
>       ==> flipH (pic1 `beside` pic2) == ((flipH pic1) `beside` (flipH pic2))

6.13 One property we can show holds is that if we take the same picture and put
four copies of it together using beside and above in the two different ways, then
the results are the same. Express this as a quickCheck property.

> prop_aboveBesides :: Picture -> Bool
> prop_aboveBesides pic = 
>   (pic `above` pic) `beside` (pic `above` pic) == (pic `beside` pic) `above` (pic `beside` pic)

6.14 You can test your implementation of rotate90 using QuickCheck. Can you think of properties which
only use rotate90 and others that use rotate? You may want to impose the condition that any picture
involved is rectangular: the function is given in the program code for this chapter.

> prop_rotate360 :: Picture -> Property
> prop_rotate360 pic =
>  (rectangular pic && (length pic) > 0)
>    ==> rotate90 (rotate90 (rotate90 (rotate90 pic))) == pic

6.15 What property would you expect invertColour to have? Can you be sure that this would hold for
randomly generated data?

I would expect a picture that is passed through invertColour twice to be equal to the original picture.
This would not hold for randomly generated data as the randomly generated data is not limited to the "." and
"#" pixels.

6.16 [Harder] Write the analogue of propAboveBeside3Correct where two pictures are again used, but
with two the same at te top (call them n) and two the same at the bottom (s, say). Do you need the condition
in this case?

> propBesideAbove3Correct :: Picture -> Picture -> Bool
> propBesideAbove3Correct n s =
>  (n `beside` n) `above` (s `beside` s)
>  ==
>  (n `above` s) `beside` (n `above` s)

In this case, it appears we do not need the condition.

> return []
> runTests = $(quickCheckAll)
